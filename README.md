## What is Anki?

> Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

Basically, Anki is a flashcard app with a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)-based memorisation system. However, you can also do the whole deck at once if that's your style, or if the exam is tomorrow.

## Importing into Anki

Firstly, get the Anki Deck Package (*.apkg) file over at the [Releases page](https://github.com/markjoshwel/compcards/releases). Or, alternatively, retrieve the latest release from the big shiny "Download" button at the top of the README.
