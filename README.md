## What is Anki?

> Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

Basically, Anki is a flashcard app with a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)-based memorisation system. You can also do the whole deck at once if that's your style, or if the exam is tomorrow.

## Importing into Anki

Firstly, get the Anki Collection Package (*.colpkg) file over at the [Releases page](https://github.com/markjoshwel/compcards/releases). Or, alternatively, retrieve the latest release from the big shiny "Download" button at the top of the README.

3. Submit a Pull Request

   _This assumes you know how to use Anki, git, and GitHub._

   1. Fork the repository.
   2. If you have the desktop version of Anki, get the [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) Add-on and import the deck. (`File > CrowdAnki: Import git repository`).
   3. After importing, fix up the neccesary cards and export as a `CrowdAnki JSON representation`. Move/drag the contents of the exported folder (`media/*` and `deck.json`) into the git repository root.
   4. Commit, and push to the forked repository.
